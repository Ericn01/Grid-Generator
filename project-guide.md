That's a great approach to get back into web development! A project that balances challenge with a manageable scope could involve building a dynamic, responsive personal portfolio website. Here's a breakdown of the project idea:

### Project: Personal Portfolio Website

**Objective:** Develop a responsive personal portfolio website that showcases your skills, projects, and resume.

**Features:**

1. **Home Page:** Introduce yourself with a photo and a brief bio.
2. **Resume Page:** Display your educational background, skills, and work experience.
3. **Projects Page:** Showcase your past projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live sites or code repositories.
4. **Contact Page:** Include a contact form that visitors can use to reach out to you. This form should validate user input using JavaScript before submission.

**Technologies:**

- **HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 to structure your website.
- **CSS:** Employ modern CSS techniques for styling and layout, such as Flexbox or Grid for responsive design. Experiment with CSS animations for subtle effects.
- **JavaScript:** Use vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation, such as interactive elements (e.g., modal windows for project details) and form validation.
- **Optional Advanced Challenge:** Incorporate a CSS preprocessor like SASS for more structured stylesheets, or use a simple build tool like Gulp to automate tasks like minifying code.

**Learning Goals:**

- **HTML and CSS:** Strengthen your understanding of semantic HTML and responsive design principles.
- **JavaScript:** Improve your problem-solving skills by implementing functionality like form validation and modal windows.
- **Project Management:** Plan and execute a complete project, from initial design to deployment.

**Steps to Start:**

1. **Design:** Sketch the layout of your website or use design tools like Figma to create a wireframe/mockup.
2. **Development Plan:** Break down the project into smaller tasks (e.g., setup project structure, develop each page, implement responsive design, add interactivity).
3. **Coding:** Start coding your website, beginning with the HTML structure, followed by CSS for styling, and then JavaScript for interactive elements.
4. **Testing:** Test your website on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy your website using a platform like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

This project will not only refresh your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also give you a platform to showcase your abilities to potential employers or clients. Plus, itâ€™s a great way to dive into more complex topics as you enhance the site over time, such as incorporating a JavaScript framework or exploring server-side programming.
